# Capsule-Networks
My thesis research involving CapsNet

### Disclaimer
The original code for CapsNet was taking from gramAI's implementation ([link](https://github.com/gram-ai/capsule-networks)). My research builds on their code.

### Contribution
Designed and implemented a Residual Capsule Layer before dynamic routing.

### To Do
1. Build identity transform for skip connection.
2. Share CIFAR Capsule weights during dynamic routing. Add signals and then squash.
